# Contributions welcome!

Stingbot is an evolving project aimed at making AI-driven security automation accessible and safe.

## How to Help

### 1. Hardening the Sandbox
The current highest priority is implementing a **Docker-based Sandbox** for all `terminal` commands. If you are experienced with container orchestration in Python, we need your help!

### 2. Observation Engine Improvements
We are constantly refining the `_summarize_observation` logic to handle massive outputs from security tools without losing critical data.

### 3. Tool Adapters
Adding specialized skills for `nuclei`, `gobuster`, or `metasploit` is highly encouraged.

## Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
- Ensure all logic remains compatible with **offline models** (Llama 3.2).
- Do not add external API dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
